# CAUTION | DISCLAIMER

The contents of this repo are just random programming exercises in a myriad of languages. These come from a variety of sources or perhaps just me tinkering. **I DO NOT ADVISE USING ANY OF THESE SCRIPTS/PROGRAMS.** They may be just as simple as a hello world script, or as complex as necessary. Anything in here is as is and may not even work. Anything that is actually a production tool of mine will be in a separate repo.

## You have been warned
